Jetfuel provides an MVC framework for writing organized, maintainable PHP web applications.

By leveraging the eZ Components Framework, Jetfuel allows you to focus on writing the application rather than low-level code. The organization and philosophies behind Jetfuel should be very familiar to developers with some exposure to Ruby on Rails.

Jetfuel intends to provide easy-to-use wrappers around many of the powerful features provided by the eZ Components framework.
