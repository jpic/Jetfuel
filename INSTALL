JetFuel Installation
=====================

Here's the quickest way to get a JetFuel installation up and running quickly. 

1.) Download and uncompress the JetFuel Archive (If you're reading this, you've probably already done this step)

2.) Download the eZ Components release from ezcomponents.org (http://www.ezcomponents.org/download). Uncompress the ezcomponents archive in the jetfuel directory. So your directory structure should look like: 

jetfuel
    app
    core
    ezcomponents-2008.1
    settings

3.) Modify the settings/environment.php to specify the location of your eZ Components base directory. Set the variables according to the comments in the file.

4.) Configure your database settings in jetfuel/settings/config.ini

5.) Set up your apache configuration to point the website's document root to the jetfuel/app/webroot directory

To Start With a Clean App
---------------------
To begin a new, empty app with JetFuel, you can start by auto-generating definition information from your database by cd'ing to your JetFuel directory and running: 
php core/scripts/createschema.php

To Start With an Example
---------------------
To try an example application, you can move or remove the 'jetfuel/app' directory and replace it with one from the 'examples' folder. Also replace the settings/routes.php with the one provided by the example.

for example: 

cd jetfuel
mv app app_blank
cp -r examples/blog/app .
cp examples/blog/settings/routes.php settings
